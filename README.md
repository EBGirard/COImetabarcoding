# Abstract

Monitoring community composition of foraminifera provides valuable insights on environmental conditions in coral reef ecosystems. Foraminiferal community compositions are currently mostly assessed through time-consuming manual sorting and classification by microscopy. In recent years, metabarcoding methods using environmental DNA (eDNA) and bulk-sample DNA (bulk-DNA) were proven to be powerful tools for monitoring the presence of taxa. For foraminifera, this has not been straightforward due to the high genetic variability in the widely used ribosomal markers. Here we show the potential of foraminiferal metabarcoding with the recently discovered mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) marker using six mock communities (eight or nine species), bulk-DNA from 10 sediment samples and environmental DNA (eDNA) from their ethanol preservative. Between three and seven technical replicates per sample were sequenced on a Illumina MiSeq to check for amplification and sequencing biases. The annotation of sequences to foraminiferal taxa was based on our self-built COI reference database. To assess the detection success in the bulk-DNA and eDNA samples with our method, we compared our results to large benthic foraminiferal communities previously reported from the same sampling locations. Results from our mock communities demonstrate that all species were detected in two mock communities and all but one in the remaining four. Technical replicates were highly similar in number of reads for each assigned ASV in both the mock communities and  bulk-DNA samples. The eDNA samples did not amplify well and also did not represent the whole diversity as detected from bulk-DNA samples. Bulk-DNA showed a significantly higher species richness than their associated eDNA samples, and also detected additional species to what was already reported at the specific locations. At this stage, our study confirmed that bulk-DNA metabarcoding using the foraminiferal COI marker adequately retrieved the diversity and community composition of both the mock communities and bulk-DNA samples. With its decreased variability compared to the commonly used nuclear 18S rRNA, the COI marker renders bulk-DNA metabarcoding a powerful tool to assess foraminiferal community composition under the condition that the reference database is adequate to the target taxa. Bulk-DNA metabarcoding would be a great addition to, for example, reef monitoring programs.
